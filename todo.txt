*the playercontroller is where pickup happens.
And i created a function called handlepickup, when that happens
an item is picked up from the floor and goes straight to the inventory
so i was thinking maybe there can be 2 inventory system:
1 for weapons and
1 for buffs
buffs can be placed into a inventory(uses array), and once it is picked up,
it just immediately grants a buff (as a status) to the player
(we can set a timer on the elements of the array(buffs) and when they expire,
we just remove the buff status)


#lin
so i added all the buffs now we need to find a way to track all the buffs i tried making an array for the buffs but didn't seeem to work, so can u try done!
!!!dao need you to scale the movement based on the speed to make sure you speed up usingthe speed buff. done!
need to make checkpoint appear below player still need!
make a next level cut scene/ or transition done!

#dao
click to shoot done
THinking about adding more buffs
thinking about making enemy spawn randomized based on code instead of JSON
//because there are 9 levels, we cant really just have 9 json for every enemy placement
