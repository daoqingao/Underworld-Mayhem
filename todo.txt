*the playercontroller is where pickup happens.
And i created a function called handlepickup, when that happens
an item is picked up from the floor and goes straight to the inventory
so i was thinking maybe there can be 2 inventory system:
1 for weapons and
1 for buffs
buffs can be placed into a inventory(uses array), and once it is picked up,
it just immediately grants a buff (as a status) to the player
(we can set a timer on the elements of the array(buffs) and when they expire,
we just remove the buff status)
